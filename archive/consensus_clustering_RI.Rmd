```{r}
library(ConsensusClusterPlus)
```
Parameters for ConsensusClusterPlus:
- d: distance matrix 
- pItem: 80% item resampling
- pFeature: 80% gene resampling 
- maxK: a maximum evaluated k of 6 so that cluster counts of 2,3,4,5,6 are evaluated (in practice a higher cluster count such as 20 is recommended)
- reps: 50 resamplings (! in practice a much hihger reps is recommended such as 1000)
- clusterAlg: agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm
- distance: 1-Perason correlation distance
- title: title for the output

```{r}
dist_dt_RI_rcName <- dist_dt_RI
rownames(dist_dt_RI_rcName) <- rownames(events_RI)
colnames(dist_dt_RI_rcName) <- rownames(events_RI)
dist_RI_cons <- as.dist(as.matrix(dist_dt_RI_rcName))
cons_mat_RI <- ConsensusClusterPlus(dist_RI_cons, maxK=6,reps=50,pItem=0.8,pFeature=1, title='Consensus matrix RI', clusterAlg='hc', distance='pearson', seed=1262118388.71279,plot='png')
```

```{r}
#Top five rows and columns of results for k=6
cons_mat_RI[[6]][["consensusMatrix"]][1:5,1:5]

#ConsensusTree - hclust object
cons_mat_RI[[6]][["consensusTree"]]

#ConsenusClass - the sample classifications
cons_mat_RI[[6]][["consensusClass"]][1:5]

```
```{r}
#ml - consensus matrix result
#clrs - colors for cluster


```
After executing ConsensusClusterPlus, one can optionally calculate cluster-
consensus and item-consensus results by:
```{r}
icl_RI = calcICL(cons_mat_RI,title='Consensus Clustering RI',plot="png")

icl_RI
icl_RI[["clusterConsensus"]]
```
