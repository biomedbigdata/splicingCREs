```{r}
library(ConsensusClusterPlus)
```
Parameters for ConsensusClusterPlus:
- d: distance matrix 
- pItem: 80% item resampling
- pFeature: 80% gene resampling 
- maxK: a maximum evaluated k of 6 so that cluster counts of 2,3,4,5,6 are evaluated (in practice a higher cluster count such as 20 is recommended)
- reps: 50 resamplings (! in practice a much hihger reps is recommended such as 1000)
- clusterAlg: agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm
- distance: 1-Perason correlation distance
- title: title for the output
